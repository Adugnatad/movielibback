# To perform migration use the following steps
    - initialize sequelize-cli by: npx sequelize-cli
    - then add your db config in the config.json file
    - then generate a migration file using the following command: npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name <MigrationName>
    - Open the generated migration file in the migrations directory. In this file, you define the changes you want to make to the database schema. Sequelize provides methods for creating and modifying tables, columns, and indexes.
    - To apply the migration and update your database, run the following command: npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
    - If you need to revert a migration, you can use the following command: npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo
